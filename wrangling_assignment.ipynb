A variable could be quantitative in one and then qualitative in another. Variables are better defined in terms of their relationships with other variables rather than in general**\n",

They could include this under a separate MENA category which provides a distinction between European and MENA descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Approximately 3.5 million respondents selected a MENA descent write-in category which demonstrates the need for a separate race category.

Some good practices would be to exclude individuals with missing data for any of the protected characteristics from any studies on that respective protected group. This is assuming that the number of people who do not answer would be relatively negligible.\n",

These kinds of variables are purely categorical and vary greatly from person to person. These characteristics are also private and confidential, so a lot of the times when this kind of data is missing, it's for a legitimate reason, which makes imputing that data at best, inaccurate, and at worst, unethical."
